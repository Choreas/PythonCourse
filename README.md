# Disclaimer

1. I don't share this with you for showing off my mad skillz
    - Because that would be stupid
    - Even if you knew I was stupid (which might be true, but how would I know), I obviously let my dog write all the code
    
2. This could make our corona home schooling / ~~home office~~ *(a term that doesn't even exist in english as I was told, 
thus work from home)* / figuring-out-what-to-do-and-must-decide-by-myself-when-to-do-it more fun: 
    - Studies have shown that you learn best when having fun (or have they?)
    - Collaborate
      - Create a repository from scratch or clone / fork this one
      - Provide your own solutions to the labs I picked
      - Provide solutions to labs you like better
      - Come up with your own ideas to practice python basics
      - Improve and add to other's code through pull requests
      - Share your repository

3. The code of honor forbids you to take any look at commit timestamps and frequency.
4. Netflix shows are hot garbage.
5. Stay healthy and be a good friend to yourself, because you might be spending some time with them over the next weeks.
